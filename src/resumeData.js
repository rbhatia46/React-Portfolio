From day one, he set himself apart with an admirable mix of drive, attention to detail, and engagement with the material. He was quick to master skills in class, to practice and self-study in any areas of relative weakness, and to share his knowledge and enthusiasm with classmates. During group work he demonstrated fantastic communication and teamwork skills, and handily juggled project management alongside his development tasks.

        Tyler is an ambitious, inquisitive developer who seeks to improve his skills constantly. I am confident that his ever-growing development skills, his dedication, and his soft skills will make him a strong asset to ANY development team.`,

He is equally as skilled at communication and collaboration. His grasp of full stack development was unsurpassed in our group. Not only was he able to learn the materials but also tutored and helped others to grasp the material as well.
        I have managed multiple teams for various organizations and owned a company for some time. If I were in search of a full stack developer for my organization he would be the first person I would contact.`,
